> üìù This file is kept as a reference for how the Blazor Hosted solution was scaffolded.

This folder will contain the solution and projects.

Recommended: create a hosted Blazor WebAssembly solution which scaffolds Client, Server and Shared projects.

From the repository root run:

```bash
# create a hosted Blazor WebAssembly solution
dotnet new blazorwasm -ho -o src/SqlQuestGame
```

After the template is created you can (optionally) move the generated projects to this repo's layout:

```bash
mv src/SqlQuestGame/Client src/SqlQuestGame.Client
mv src/SqlQuestGame/Server src/SqlQuestGame.Server
mv src/SqlQuestGame/Shared src/SqlQuestGame.Shared
```

Or manually create projects if you prefer:

- `SqlQuestGame.Client` ‚Äî Blazor WebAssembly
- `SqlQuestGame.Server` ‚Äî ASP.NET Core Web API
- `SqlQuestGame.Shared` ‚Äî class library for DTOs/models

After scaffolding, commit the projects and push to trigger CI/CD workflows.
