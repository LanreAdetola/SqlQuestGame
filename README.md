# ðŸ§  SQL Quest Game (Azure Edition)
**Learn SQL by playing â€” powered by Azure and Blazor.**

SQL Quest Game is a cloud-based educational web app that helps learners practice SQL through interactive, real-world challenges.  
Players connect to an **Azure SQL Database**, run real queries, and submit answers through a **Blazor WebAssembly app** â€” gaining hands-on experience with data exploration and cloud technologies.

## Tech stack

- Frontend: Blazor WebAssembly (.NET 8)
- Backend: ASP.NET Core Web API
- Database: Azure SQL Database
- Infrastructure as Code: Bicep
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Authentication: Azure Static Web Apps (GitHub Login)

## Project phases

1. Foundation â€” repo scaffolding, IaC (Bicep), CI/CD pipelines
2. Core Application â€” Blazor app + API + SQL connection
3. Gamification â€” leaderboard, scoring, progress tracking
4. SQL Editor â€” Monaco-based query interface
5. Insights & AI â€” Azure OpenAI hints, analytics, Power BI dashboards

## Infrastructure (Phase 0)

Resources are provisioned using Azure Bicep and include (typical):

- Azure SQL Database
- Azure App Service (API)
- Azure Static Web Apps (Blazor client)

Key files

```
infrastructure/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.bicep
â”œâ”€â”€ parameters.json
â””â”€â”€ readme.md
.github/workflows/
â”œâ”€â”€ infra-deploy.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ backend-deploy.yml
â””â”€â”€ frontend-deploy.yml
```

## Required GitHub secrets

Add these secrets to the repository to enable automated deployments:

| Secret name | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| AZURE_CREDENTIALS | JSON output from an Azure service principal used by GitHub Actions |
| AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID | Azure subscription id used by deployment workflows |
| SQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD | Administrator password for the Azure SQL Database (used during provisioning) |
| AZURE_PUBLISH_PROFILE | App Service publish profile (for App Service deployment) |
| AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN | Token used to deploy the static site / API to Azure Static Web Apps |

## Getting started (local)

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/SqlQuestGame.git
cd SqlQuestGame
```

2. Open the solution

```bash
cd src/SqlQuestGame
dotnet restore
```

3. Run the app locally (development)

```bash
cd src/SqlQuestGame/SqlQuestGame
dotnet run
```

Open https://localhost:5001 in your browser (or follow the URLs from the console output).

Notes

- The repository already contains separate `Client`, `Server`, and `Shared` projects under `src/SqlQuestGame`.
- The workflows in `.github/workflows` will deploy infrastructure and apps when pushed to `main` (if configured and secrets are set).

## Learning outcomes

By working through this project you will:

- Build a full-stack cloud app using Azure and Blazor
